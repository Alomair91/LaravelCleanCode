[SOLID Principles in PHP](https://laracasts.com/series/solid-principles-in-php)
SOLID represents a series of guidelines that developers can use to, if done well, simplify and clarify their code. While certainly not laws, understanding these concepts will make you a better developer.

[Design Patterns in PHP](https://laracasts.com/series/design-patterns-in-php)
A design pattern is a common solution to a common problem. Nothing more, nothing less. And, while some of these approaches might seem foreign or overwhelming to you, the important thing to remember is that, as a developer, you are in charge. That means you decide when a pattern is appropriate, and when it's completely unnecessary. That's the key.
